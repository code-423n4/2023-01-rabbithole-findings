1. RabbitHoleReceipt - normal `uint` variable can be used instead of `CountersUpgradeable.Counter private _tokenIds`.
2. No need to compare to boolean value in `QuestFactory.createQuest` function. ! should be used.
    ```solidity
    if (rewardAllowlist[rewardTokenAddress_] == false) revert RewardNotAllowed();
    ```
    ```solidity
    if (!rewardAllowlist[rewardTokenAddress_]) revert RewardNotAllowed();
    ```
3. No need to compare to boolean value in `QuestFactory.mintReceipt` function.
    ```solidity
    if (quests[questId_].addressMinted[msg.sender] == true) revert AddressAlreadyMinted();
    ```
    ```solidity
    if (quests[questId_].addressMinted[msg.sender]) revert AddressAlreadyMinted();
    ```
4. In RabbitHoleReceipt contract, `ERC721URIStorageUpgradeable` is inherited but never used. This increases the bytecode of contract and adds extra function selectors in function dispatcher costing more gas to users.

5. In RabbitHoleReceipt contract `QuestFactoryContract` and `minterAddress` should be same addresses so these values can be stored in a single variable. As RabbitHoleReceipt tokens are minted only via QuestFactoryContract.

6. In RabbitHoleReceipt `timestampForTokenId` is never used inside the protocol. In needed, minting timestamp of token can be queried from events on off-chain components. No need to store extra data on-chain.
