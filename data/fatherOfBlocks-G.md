- L73/221 - In a validation, rewardAllowlist[rewardTokenAddress_] == false is validated, and less gas cost could be generated by doing: !rewardAllowlist[rewardTokenAddress_]. The same thing also happens with quests[questId_].addressMinted[msg.sender] == true.

- L168/169/170/172/184/185 - A variable is created in memory, but it is only used once, therefore the variable should be removed and the operation used directly where it is needed.
