### [S-01] Misleading modifier name
Modifier called `onlyAdminWithdrawAfterEnd` should be called `onlyAfterEnd` because it only checks `endTime`, and has nothing to do with admin privileges.
```solidity
File: Quest.sol

L76:	modifier onlyAdminWithdrawAfterEnd() {
		if (block.timestamp < endTime) revert NoWithdrawDuringClaim();
		_;
	}
```

### [L-01] `Erc1155Quest`'s tokens can be withdrawn before every reward has been claimed
#### Impact
The owner can withdraw all the remaining tokens after the Quest `endTime`. Thus, users who have not claimed their reward at the end of the quest may not be able to do so because the tokens can be withdrawn by the owner beforehand.
#### Proof Of Concept
The `withdrawRemainingTokens()` function withdraws all token balance whithout checking unclaimed tokens. 
```solidity
File: Erc1155Quest.sol

L56:	IERC1155(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(
		address(this),
		to_,
		rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId,
		IERC1155(rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this), rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId),
		'0x00'
	);
```
