1. Incorrect variable name: rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId 

[https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/Erc20Quest.sol#L46](https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/Erc20Quest.sol#L46)

The variable rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId has to be a monetary value for the accounting to work further on.
I'm assuming that reward amount in wei is of a far greater value than a tokenId and if that's true then the starting function, later on, will start even when the balance on the contract is less than the amount needed for the awards.

Recommendation:

Change the variable name to rewardAmountInWei. As to not confuse the person calling the Quest

2. No checks on the tokenId.length

The for loop inside the function loops the length of the tokenIds, which is input by the admin, however, there needs to be a check that the tokenId.length doesn't exceed the gas limit

3. No checks for minting Idâ€™s

No checks the input Ids are accurate meaning the minter can mint tokens for incorrect ids_

4. Some contracts use uint and some use uint256:

Look in RabitHoleReceipt contract.
