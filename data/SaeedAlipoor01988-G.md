Why are you using a constructor when your smart contract is upgradeable and you donâ€™t need a constructor function?

Due to a requirement of the proxy-based upgradeability system, no constructors can be used in upgradeable contracts.

++i/i++ should be unchecked{++i}/unchecked{i++} when it is not possible for them to overflow, as is the case when used in for- and while-loops.
The unchecked keyword is new in solidity version 0.8.0, so this only applies to that version or higher, which these instances are. This saves 30-40 gas per loop.
