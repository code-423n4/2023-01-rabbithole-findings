# 1: FLOATING PRAGMA

Vulnerability details

### Impact

Contracts should be deployed using the same compiler version/flags with which they have been tested. Locking the floating pragma, i.e. by not using ^ in pragma solidity ^0.8.15, ensures that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using an older compiler version with unfixed bugs.

For reference, see https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-103

## Tools Used

Manual Analysis

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Remove ^ in “pragma solidity ^0.8.15” and change it to “pragma solidity 0.8.15” to be consistent with the rest of the contracts.


# 2: USE A MORE RECENT VERSION OF SOLIDITY

Vulnerability details

## Context:

All contracts

## Description:

For security, it is best practice to use the latest Solidity version.

For the security fix list in the versions; see https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/Changelog.md

## Tools Used

Manual Analysis

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Old version of Solidity is used , newer version can be used (0.8.17)
