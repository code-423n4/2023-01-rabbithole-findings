## Gas Optimazition Summary




### [GAS-01]<x> += <y> costs more gas than <x> = <x> + <y> for state variables      
Using the addition operator instead of plus-equals saves gas

## [G-02] `++I`/`I++` SHOULD BE `UNCHECKED{++I}`/`UNCHECKED{I++}` WHEN IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO OVERFLOW, AS IS THE CASE WHEN USED IN FOR- AND WHILE-LOOPS

The unchecked keyword is new in solidity version 0.8.0, so this only applies to that version or higher, which these instances are. This saves 30-40 gas PER LOOP
