## `onlyOwner` modifier called two times for the same function `withdrawRemainingTokens`

In contract `ERC20Quest`, for function https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/Erc20Quest.sol#L81 there is `onlyOwner` modifier, which also exists in the base contract https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/Quest.sol#L150, which is called with `super.withdrawRemainingTokens(to_);` in line https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/Erc20Quest.sol#L83. 

The same situation is also in contract `ERC1155Quest` https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/Erc1155Quest.sol#L54 where also the super or base contract is called https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/Erc1155Quest.sol#L55.

I suggest removing the `onlyOwner` modifier from https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/Erc20Quest.sol#L81  and also from https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/Erc1155Quest.sol#L54.
