Description:
The smart contract function "createQuest" within the contract utilizes a string variable "questId_" to identify a quest. However, using strings as identifiers can lead to potential vulnerabilities such as reentrancy attacks and a higher likelihood of collisions. Additionally, strings take up more storage space compared to bytes32.

Recommendation:
To mitigate these risks, it is recommended to change the type of the "questId_" variable from string to bytes32. This will not only improve the security of the contract but also reduce the amount of storage space required.
