## [G-01] `<X> += <Y>` COSTS MORE GAS THAN `<X> = <X> + <Y>` FOR STATE VARIABLES

Using the addition operator instead of plus-equals saves gas

## [G-02] INTERNAL FUNCTIONS ONLY CALLED ONCE CAN BE INLINED TO SAVE GAS

Not inlining costs 20 to 40 gas because of two extra JUMP instructions and additional stack operations needed for function calls.

## [G-03] PUBLIC FUNCTIONS NOT CALLED BY THE CONTRACT SHOULD BE DECLARED EXTERNAL INSTEAD

Contracts are allowed to override their parentsâ€™ functions and change the visibility from external to public and can save gas by doing so.

## [G-04] FUNCTIONS GUARANTEED TO REVERT WHEN CALLED BY NORMAL USERS CAN BE MARKED PAYABLE

If a function modifier or require such as onlyOwner/onlyX is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as payable will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are CALLVALUE(2), DUP1(3), ISZERO(3), PUSH2(3), JUMPI(10), PUSH1(3), DUP1(3), REVERT(0), JUMPDEST(1), POP(2) which costs an average of about 21 gas per call to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost.

**Recommended Mitigation Steps**

Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked payable.

## [G-05] SETTING THE `CONSTRUCTOR` TO `PAYABLE`
