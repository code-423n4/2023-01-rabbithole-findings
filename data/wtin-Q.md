## Upgradeable contract is missing a `__gap[50]` storage variable to allow for new storage variables in later versions

See this [link](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps) for a description of this storage variable. While some contracts may not currently be sub-classed, adding the variable now protects against forgetting to add it in the future.
